## Introduction
According to the CDC motor vehicle safety division, one in five accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year. 

Shocked by the statistics, this project was developed based on the Kaggle challenge originally brought up by an insurance company to see whether a dashboard camera can capture the distracted driver and elaborated further on adding data augmentation and application to real-world scenarios.
